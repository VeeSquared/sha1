# SHA-1 Hash Algorithm

## Description:
This is a simulated design of the SHA-1 Hash Algorithm developed in Verilog. The simulated design takes input of a message and computes it into a 160-bit SHA1 hash. The simulated design utilizes multiple pipelines to increase performance of the algorithm and reduce area delay between the execution of each instruction.
